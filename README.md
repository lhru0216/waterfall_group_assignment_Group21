# Small Library Management System (Waterfall SDLC)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Library Management System** developed to simulate the **Traditional Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. The system is designed to automate manual library processes such as book tracking, member registration, and borrowing transactions.

This repository serves as the central documentation and codebase, organized strictly according to the sequential phases of the Waterfall model.

## 📝 Reflection on Waterfall Model
*Included in the Final Presentation slides.*
Key learning points included the strict "phase freezing," the heavy emphasis on documentation before coding, and the difficulty of accommodating the "Late Fee" change request once the Design phase was closed.
